### Note
I'm actually getting quite burnt out on this project. I feel like with the exception of one person, nobody actually cares about the person behind the project.

I'm wearing thin, and I'm wearing thin _fast_.

As of now, one more bugfix is planned but after that, the project will be indefinitely on hold. If you want to contribute, feel free and I can pull merge requests.

### Note
I have been really busy with life. I don't think I can maintain this project as much as I could before, and I've also had issues motivating myself with this project.

I will have the source readily available, at least one iteration of Wings of Vaivora, once I have completed rewriting Settings. Please bear with me. I know it's been a long while, and for those who may want to look into the code, I'm just one person maintaining everything.

Thank you.

### Changed
- Changed Demon Lord grouping

## [1.7.15] - 2017-08-01
### Added

## [1.7.13] - 2017-08-01

## [1.7.12] - 2017-07-31

## [1.7.11] - 2017-07-28
### Added
- Added Abomination anchor option. `$boss abom anchored 0:00` produces an alert 1 hour from the anchor time.

### Fixed
- Set exception handling for tracking repeat messages

### Acknowledgment

## [1.7.10] - 2017-07-20

## [1.7.9] - 2017-07-08
### Fixed
- Adjusted anchor message using `$boss list`

## [1.7.8] - 2017-07-08
### Fixed
- Fixed logic errors with empty maps again - resolved with changing list with `Map Unknown` to empty string

## [1.7.7] - 2017-07-08
### Fixed
- Fixed logic errors with getting changelogs. Sorry, I know you guys must have gotten too many changelogs lately through PM, mostly repetitive.

## [1.7.6] - 2017-07-08
### Fixed
- Alerts are now fixed for a couple more issues.
    1. handling 12pm - solved using hour > 24 instead of hour > 23
    2. handling empty maps - solved by assigning an unbound variable on the condition

## [1.7.5] - 2017-07-08
### Changed
- Alerts will no longer use a redundant measure of text files in raw info to prevent repeat of duplicate mentions. And... (see Fixed)
- Caveat to new alert/periodic check system: if bot goes offline and you had a record still valid, you will receive at least one duplicate mention.

### Fixed
- Alerts are now fixed. Sorry. This was long overdue and I've had issues and was occupied today. This was a couple issues:
    1. not converting local time (Pacific Daylight Time) to server time (Eastern Daylight Time) - solved using `timedelta(hours=-3)`
    2. not sending to the right channel, instead a `str` which discord.py made no sense of - solved using `channel.id`
    3. not sending messages after input - solved using `message.server` instead of `server_id`
    4. not sending messages on account of syntax/type error - solved by typing to `str`

## [1.7.4] - 2017-07-07
